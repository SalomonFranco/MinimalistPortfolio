In the spring of 2023, a remarkable group of students from the U.S. came together, bound by curiosity and a spirit of adventure, to explore the rich culture and landscapes of Peru. This trip wasn’t just a journey to a new place—it was a journey into friendships and connections that would last a lifetime. From the heights of Machu Picchu, where they marveled at ancient Inca architecture, to the vibrant streets of Cusco filled with history and life, the students immersed themselves fully, each experience adding another layer to their understanding of the world and each other. 

Together, they tasted Peruvian flavors, danced to local music, and engaged with communities, learning about the people whose heritage stretches back thousands of years. This trip became more than just sightseeing; it was a shared adventure that brought a diverse class closer and fostered memories captured beautifully in an album filled with laughter, awe, and the unbreakable bonds they formed along the way. Each photo in the album tells its own story—moments of discovery, challenge, joy, and friendship that define the Class of 2023’s unforgettable journey through Peru.
